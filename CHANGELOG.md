## 1.2.0 (30. April 2019)

+ [#7](https://github.com/nadar/quill-delta-parser/pull/7) Makes sure input and attributes from delta is escaped before mixing it with html. Listeners should use `$line->getInput()` instead of `$line->input` to read input. This will properly escape if it is not done already. Values from attributes should be passed through `$line->getLexer()->escape()`. See the [Color listener](src/listener/Color.php) for an example of both. Obviously, escaping should be skipped in case a listener is meant to output raw html.
